What's Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. Sign up to participate today at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com.

Rules and prizes
First, sign up on the Hacktoberfest site at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests between October 1-31. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

Connect with other Hacktoberfest participants by using #hacktoberfest on your social media platform of choice.
